I've been coding websites since 1995. The only thing that hasn't changed much is the constant flux and evolution. There's always something new to be learned.

I was hired as a technical support analyst at an ISP. As a side project, I created an internal knowledgebase. This impressed my boss enough to help create an internal webmaster position. This new position also introduced me to the world of unix system administration, managing DNS and web-hosting servers. I even created some gnarly PERL scripts that lessoned the manual entry and removal tasks.

Serving in multiple techincal roles has really helped defined my biggest asset, versatility. It's also incredibly helpful to offer a perspective that bridges between technical, creative and business teams. 

My positions have evolved into more of a content authoring role in the enterprise. I still inhabit a unique space where i'm part graphic designer and part front-end developer. One of the things I enjoy the most is learning new tricks and skills. I take time every morning to learn something new. 

--------
I still use HTML, CSS and Javascript but now in more of a hack the content management system, as they tend to be large, inflexible systems. 

I believe my biggest asset professionally has been my versatility. I've had to often learn a new system or technology, and get up to speed quickly. My background in graphic design, video production, music and computer networking has also helped in coming up with solutions that draw on upon these skills.

My career on the web started when my supervisor saw I could write HTML and asked if I'd be interested in creating a help site for our technical support staff. From there I was promoted to Webmaster and began working on content and design for the corporate site. I worked closely with Marketing, and also oversaw the web-hosting department, creating and maintaining user accounts. That led me to developing my unix skillset, which led me to learn how to program in PERL and MySQL.

My roles since then have been more focused on the corporate and enterprise content. Quality, accuracy and speed are all important factors. I inhabit a unique space where I'm part Graphic Designer, part Front-End Developer. I'm always learning and expanding my skillset. That's been one of the best things about this line of work. I might never be an expert, but to me, that's a good thing. It means I still have the capacity to learn.
